## Myles' Social Meida

# View on Vercel : https://my-social-network-avv1xhc23-myles-projects-c49d08e3.vercel.app/

This is a simple social media application created by me with next js, vercel/postgres and clerk authentication
A user must create an account and then profile with username and bio before they may create posts
Access to other user's posts and profiles, with the ability to post comments on them will only be available when a user is authenticated also
I have used a radix ui component to display the 'posts' a user has made
